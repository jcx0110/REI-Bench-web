      <h2 class="abstract-heading">Abstract</h2>
      <p class="text-abstract">
        Robot task planning decomposes human instructions into executable action sequences that enable robots to complete a series of complex tasks. Although recent large language model (LLM)-based task planners achieve amazing performance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward. However, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots often contain significant vagueness. Linguists suggest that such vagueness frequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend heavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more prevalent among the elderly and children, who are the groups that robots should serve more. This paper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects LLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. <span style="color: magenta;">To this end, we propose the first robot task planning benchmark that systematically models vague REs grounded in pragmatic theory (REI-Bench), where we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning performance, leading to success rate drops of up to 36.9%.</span> We also observe that most failure cases stem from missing objects in planners. To mitigate the REs issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach: task-oriented context cognition, which generates clear instructions for robots, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to aware prompts, chains of thought, and in-context learning. By tackling the overlooked issue of vagueness, this work contributes to the research community by advancing real-world task planning and making robots more accessible to non-expert users, e.g., the elderly and children.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p class="text-default">
        Robots are getting better at following natural language instructions thanks to large language models (LLMs). But there's a catch: most current systems assume humans always speak clearly and precisely. In reality, we don’t. We often say things like “it” or “that heavy thing,” expecting others to figure it out from context. While humans are great at this, robots struggle—especially in real-world settings like kitchens, where vague terms can lead to serious misunderstandings. 
        This kind of vagueness, known as coreferential vagueness, is everywhere in our daily language. It happens when we refer to something without naming it directly. For example, “Move it” could mean a pot, a plate, or anything else nearby. Humans use context and memory to guess the right meaning, but LLM-based robot planners often fail.

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p class="text-default">
        We study how implicit referring expressions (REs)—vague or indirect references in multi-turn human-robot dialogues—affect the performance of LLM-based robot task planners. Unlike prior work focusing on clear, single-turn instructions, our method systematically models different levels of RE vagueness and dialogue context variations that introduce ambiguity. We create the REI dataset based on embodied task instructions, combining various RE types and context conditions to benchmark planners. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective prompting method, TOCC, to help planners better interpret implicit REs and improve task success rates.

<p class="text-default">
  Existing LLM-based task planners struggle to handle instructions in multi-turn dialogues, particularly when implicit referring expressions introduce ambiguity. In contrast, noise and partial context omission have less impact on their performance. These challenges are common in real-world human-robot interactions and need to be addressed.

<h3>Prompting Method</h3>
<p class="text-default">
  Among the three prompting methods compared, TOCC achieves the best performance by separating implicit RE resolution from task planning and providing clearer instructions. While AP improves performance by highlighting potential vagueness, it can sometimes cause confusion, and CoT offers moderate improvement through autonomous analysis of implicit REs.
